Hey, welcome to the Dev Pathways repo! Dev Pathways is a React app that aims to compile learning resources for popular technologies and serve them to users in a personalized way. As ACM has grown itâ€™s become clear that we as an organization need to find a better way to support our new devs, and its our mission at the Dev Pathways team to make that happen! By establishing a single source for learning all the technologies that the ACM dev teams use, we hope to make onboarding new developers smoother than ever before.

## Development Setup

We'll use a really common Node.js project workflow!

First, let's clone our repository, and install all of our node dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/dev-pathways.git
cd dev-pathways
yarn install
```

To start our app, you just need to run `yarn start`!

```
yarn start
```

And to build our project for production (with CRA's webpack bundling and all that goodness),

```
yarn run build
```

## Contribution Workflow

Want to make a change? Great! Here are the steps:

1. Either make a new branch or a fork of this repository. `master` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
2. Follow the instructions in "Development Setup" above. If you're on a fork, replace the URL with the fork's URL; if you're on a different branch, check it out using `git checkout`.
3. Make your changes!
4. **Before you push**, make sure your app builds with `yarn run build`. If there are any errors, our CI/CD service will **reject your build**.
5. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes!
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/uclaacm/dev-pathways/pulls) with your changes, and let someone on the dev team know. Netlify has a neat feature called "Deploy Previews" that give you a link to preview your changes; [see the blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) for more info!
7. If your code passes code review, we'll merge it into `master`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch/fork.
