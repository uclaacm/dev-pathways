//NOTE:
//  - resource names should be both descriptive and concise (< 40 characters)
//  - in general (with some exceptions), external resources should be ranked below resources coming from ACM
//  - each resource can contain several links (video, article, interactive, or doc) that indicate the resource type(s)
//  - only first 5 resources are shown in resources drop down (so most important are at top)
